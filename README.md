# inc ðŸ“Œ

**inc** is an [incremental note-taking system](https://thesephist.com/posts/inc/) â€” it's an experimental tool for growing a knowledge base by incrementally adding to a database of ideas rather than managing a complex collection of documents that change arbitrarily.

## Setup and installation



## inc, managed with inc

Future roadmap items, project ideas, and other random development tasks are tracked within the project using inc itself, in the `inc.db.json` database.

For todos and future roadmap, see the locally included DB:

```
inc ls
```

- `inc /#todo` for todos
- `inc /#idea` for future feature ideas

To see the repository-local Inc database, set `INC_DB_PATH` to the path of the repository root.
